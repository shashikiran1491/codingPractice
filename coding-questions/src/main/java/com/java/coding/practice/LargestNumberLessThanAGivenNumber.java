/**
 * How to find largest number less than a given number and without a given digit?
 * <p>
 * Write a Java program to find the largest number ‘L’ less than a given number ‘N’
 * which should not contain a given digit ‘D’.
 * <p>
 *  For example, If 145 is the given number and 4 is the given digit,
 *  then you should find the largest number less than 145 such that
 *  it should not contain 4 in it. In this case, 139 will be the answer.
 *  <p>
 *  given number n = 145
 *  given digit d = 4
 *  <p>
 *  o/p = 139. Largest Number which does not contain d
